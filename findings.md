# Build findings

Probe results where reality contradicted the brief or the research, found
while implementing v2. Same discipline as the validation campaign: every
entry is MEASURED (observed live on this machine) or READ (source/doc
inspection), with the probe that proved it. The validation campaign's
F1-F12 live in `~/projects/cyclops-arch/findings.md`; numbering here
continues from F13.

## F13. refresh-client -B subscriptions work in control mode on tmux 3.6a (MEASURED)

Subscribing `name:%pane:#{pane_title}\t#{pane_dead}\t#{pane_in_mode}\t#{pane_current_command}`
produces %subscription-changed for select-pane -T from outside, OSC 2 printf
from inside the pane, and copy-mode entry/exit. This makes subscriptions the
watcher's primary per-pane change signal (zero polling holds). Caveat: the
initial value push after subscribing is lazy, so bootstrap must come from
list-panes, never from the subscription's first event. Proven by
crates/cyclops-tmux/tests/subscription_probe.rs, which documents the fallback
if a future tmux breaks it.

## F14. tmux sanitizes control-mode replies to '_' for non-UTF-8 clients; spawn tmux -u (MEASURED, high severity)

With no LC_ALL/LC_CTYPE/LANG naming UTF-8 in the client environment, tmux
3.6a replaces tabs and non-ASCII in command reply blocks with underscores:
tab-separated list-panes formats collapse and Claude's braille spinner titles
(the F5/F6 title sensor) are destroyed. This hits exactly the environments a
daemon runs in (launchd, cron, CI). The validation campaign could not see it:
CPython's PEP 538 locale coercion exports LC_CTYPE=C.UTF-8 to child
processes, so every Python probe was silently immune. The Rust client always
passes -u; any other tmux invocation that parses formatted output needs -u
too. Route all tmux access through cyclops-tmux.

## F15. pause-after switches output notifications to %extended-output (MEASURED)

Once `refresh-client -f pause-after=300` is set (amendment a, done at
attach), pane output arrives as `%extended-output %pane age : data` instead
of %output. A consumer matching only %output goes blind right after enabling
flow control. The watcher treats both as activity.

## F16. %begin flags field separates unsolicited blocks from command replies (MEASURED)

On 3.6a the implicit post-attach block carries flags 0; replies to commands
from this client carry flags 1, and %end/%error repeat the %begin command
number. Correlation accepts a terminator only when the number matches, so
pane content that happens to look like control-mode lines cannot confuse it.
Notifications did not interleave inside reply blocks in any observed case.

## F17. paste-buffer -p brackets only when the app enabled mode 2004 (MEASURED)

A plain `cat` pane receives the payload unbracketed; the markers appear only
after the application requests bracketed paste (printf '\033[?2004h'). The
round-trip test proves byte-exact delivery (quotes, backslashes, tabs, UTF-8,
embedded newlines) with mode 2004 on. Confirms amendment b's stance: the
paste path cannot be gated on bracketing; composer verification is the gate.

## F18. macOS setsockopt(SO_RCVTIMEO) fails with EINVAL once the peer closed (MEASURED)

Reproduced in the CLI e2e tests: set_read_timeout(None) on a UnixStream
whose peer already closed fails with EINVAL while buffered lines remain
readable. The CLI swallows the error and lets the next read report the
close. Anything adjusting socket timeouts mid-connection on macOS must
tolerate this or it will hide readable data behind a misnamed error.
