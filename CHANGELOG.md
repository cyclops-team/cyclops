## [Unreleased]

### Added (M0: shadow daemon)

- cyclops-tmux: control-mode client with FIFO reply correlation, pause-after
  flow control at attach, and a zero-polling reconciling pane watcher built
  on refresh-client -B subscriptions (probed on tmux 3.6a). All tmux access
  passes -u after finding F14.
- cyclopsd: read-only shadow daemon: config, sensor fusion over manifest
  rules (title + screen, observable disagreement), NDJSON socket server with
  ping/status/pane.read/events.subscribe, peer-credential capture, clean
  signal shutdown.
- cyclops: status/ping/read/watch with strict-grid rendering, semantic color
  slots with truecolor/256 fallback, NO_COLOR and --plain support.
- cyclops-ledger: crash-safe append-only writer (fsync, torn-tail sealing,
  monotonic seq across restarts) and cursor replay reader.
- Python probe harness ported from the validation campaign; demos/m0-status.sh
  end-to-end demo; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/DELIVERY.md, docs/GOALS.md.
- Milestone workflow queue (.claude/workflows/m1..m6) with preflight gates.
- findings.md F13-F18 (subscription probe, tmux -u locale sanitization,
  %extended-output switch, %begin flags correlation, bracketed-paste
  conditionality, macOS SO_RCVTIMEO EINVAL).

### Added (scaffold)

- Workspace scaffold: cyclops-proto (protocol v1 + ledger schema),
  cyclops-manifest (detection manifests with modal decline actions),
  cyclops-tmux (version probe), cyclopsd and cyclops binary stubs.
- Shipped detection manifests for Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Antigravity
  CLI, seeded from the 2026-08-01 validation campaign.
- CI: fmt, clippy, tests on ubuntu/macos, advisory tmux-HEAD job.
- docs/GOALS.md: the admin-set quality bar.
